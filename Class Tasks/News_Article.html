               <h2>AI in Web Design</h2>
            </li>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Artificial Intelligence is becoming a mainstream design partner. Tools like Framer AI, Uizard, and Adobeâ€™s Firefly now generate entire website layouts within minutes. Designers are focusing more on creative direction while AI handles repetitive tasks.</p>

               <h2>Dark Mode & Dynamic Themes</h2>
            </li>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Dark mode has become a default expectation. But the new shift is toward dynamic themes that automatically adapt to user preferences, environment lighting, or even time of day.</p>

                <h2>3D & Immersive Elements</h2>
            </li>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;" >Websites are no longer flat. With WebGPU and WebXR, 3D models, AR previews, and interactive product displays are finding their way into e-commerce, gaming, and education platforms.</p>

    <h2>Minimalism with Micro-interactions</h2>
</li>
<p style ="font-size: 20px ;">Clean layouts paired with subtle animations are ruling the scene. Micro-interactions, like hover effects or smooth button transitions, make user experiences more engaging without overwhelming them.</p>

    <h2>
        Accessibility First
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Inclusive design is no longer optional. New WCAG 3.0 guidelines are pushing websites to prioritize readability, contrast, voice navigation, and assistive-friendly structures.</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Faster, Lighter Websites</h2><p style="font-size: 20px;">Performance remains critical. With Core Web Vitals updates, Google is favoring ultra-fast, mobile-first, and lightweight designs. Static site generators and headless CMS solutions are gaining popularity for speed optimization.</p></li>
